I think a lot about a lot of things â€“ some useful and some not so much! I love thinking under the shower, while driving and listening to the radio, and while doodling. What is this life all about? Where does it lead? What is the purpose of my life? Why is there so much snow in winter (sigh!) and why have started putting on weight after 30!!

I am going to chronicle my thoughts, my understanding of philosophy, and occasional rants and shout-outs to awesome people I come across!

See ya!
