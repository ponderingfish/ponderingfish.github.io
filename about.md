Politics in India is never quiet and calm. Gone are the days of the brilliant orators and statemanly qualities of those who walk through the hallowed walls of the Parliament building. Nowadays, you probably need to take a crash course in microphone-throwing, ducking under the desk, gherao-ing, and the most important of all -- rushing into the well. 

It appears to me that the Speaker of the House is a ring-master trying to tame her circus performers. I thought that it would be a friendly gesture to give her a hand at this task, and thus was born - political tamasha. 

Everyone has their personal favorites when it comes to politics and I am no exception. I love to argue and defend the indefensible just like the guy next to me and for that matter - even you! So, if you see something that irks you, then I encourage you to leave a comment and start a debate. 

I do request everyone to keep the discussion civil -- we are a nation of tolerant people right? (despite what Aamir Khan would like us to believe).
