Its hard not to admit that [PM Modi's "Mann ki Baat" radio program](http://www.narendramodi.in/mann-ki-baat){:target="_blank"} is strikingly refreshing and a much needed change after a decade of wondering when Dr. Manmohan Singh would open his mouth. And even if he did open his mouth, one would need a very high-speed camera (talking about several thousand frames/sec) to capture that spectacular phenomenon. I guess that's too harsh -- knowing fully well that puppets don't speak. yea. We'll let that one pass and focus on the present.

So what exactly does PM Modi talk on the radio? Well, [apart from jamming with Obama](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG7YPR6AQ){:target="_blank"}, he is generally found talking about new initiatives (clean India, organ donation, etc.). I think this is simply wonderful and to harness the power of the simple radio to reach out to millions of rural Indians is a stroke of brilliance. A perfect follow-up act to using holographs while on the campaign trail. 

So the questions begs to be answered -- how on Earth does a man with the "Mann ki Baat" juggernaut at his disposal, a man with oratorical skills second-to-none, a man who doesn't need notes (unlike Rahul baba who can't remember what the three monkeys signify with the help of a cheat-sheet), a man whose vocabulary goes far beyond "women empowerment" and "my grandmother" -- how does such a leader lose the plot completely and lets a bunch of goons and motor-mouths go scot-free while not saying anything on the matter.

Arnab Goswami's debates were getting painful to watch with the Congress spokespersons holding on to only one question - "Why doesn't the PM talk about all the intolerance in this country?" Seriously, why didn't he talk about this?

Silence is slowly and steadily becoming a feature of Modi's prime ministership. When Vasundara Raje and Sushma Swaraj got entangled in the Lalit Modi visa issue, he kept quiet. When the Dadri lynching occurred, he kept quiet. When the poor little dalit children were killed, he kept quiet. When Kalburgi was murdered in Karnataka, he kept quiet. When the whole award-wapsi charade took place, he kept quiet. 

WHY?

Why would he keep quiet? Especially when he has the Mann ki Baat vehicle! Come on PM Modi -- you could have held a radio + television interview and talked directly to the people in India's cowbelt. You could have given a subtle warning to the motor-mouths in the BJP and RSS to shut it. You could have innocently suggested that the Samajwadi Party and Congress get their act together and ensure that such incidents never take place again. In one fell swoop, you could have shut the award-wapsi charade even before it began. Unfortunately, you chose to stay silent and poor Anupam Kher had to bat in your place. You chose to remain silent and instead address these issues in the Parliament at the start of the Winter Session. Even though you delivered a well-crafted speech, you missed the bus by not talking when it mattered. Timing is everything and Modi certainly missed the beat on this one.

A single radio show would have achieved several objectives 
- it would brought about the sense of security knowing that there is a PM who is looking out and is reactive 
- put the onus where it lies -- at the state-level. How many Karnataka Sahitya Academy winners returned their awards? Close to none! Kalburgi and Janardhan Poojary were killed in Karnataka which is being ruled by the completely inept Siddaramaiah and yet, nobody in the media bothered to grill the Congress party in a manner similar to how the BJP is getting their ass kicked. Stinks of supari journalism right? 
- and most importantly, Modi's words would have done magic for the Bihar elections. It is such a coincidence that the award-wapsi charade stopped as soon as the Bihar election results were announced. Perfectly timed huh? A few words from Modi might have tilted the balance in BJP's favor. But he chose to stay mum and the opposition pounced on this silence and branded him as a supporter of intolerance.

The power of speech should never be underestimated and for Modi to not talk and stifle his innate talent is foolish. I am not sure which moder-day Chanakya is behind this, but he certainly needs an upgrade.
