The "Mann ki Baat" radio program is one of the strikingly refreshing aspects of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 1.5 year rule at the center. Simply put - it is a monthly radio program hosted by the PM in which he chooses to introduce new programs, spread awareness regarding certain pet projects (e.g. Swachh Bharath) and encouraging people to enroll in organ donation. All of this is great and much needed after a decade of wondering if our former PM Manmohan Singh had lost his voice. But,
coming to think of it - puppets don't speak! They only move thir hands and legs and occasionally their lower jaw drops and then goes back into position. So, we really can't blame Dr. Singh too much on this! He just couldn't help it! 

But, here we have someone cast from a totally different metal. A metal that has been hardened by the school of hard knocks. An orator par-excellent and a man with ideas. After a blistering prime ministerial campaign that included internet, whatsapp, door-to-door and even holographic campaigns, it seems that our PM has lost his voice!
