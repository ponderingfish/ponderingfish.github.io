Its hard not to admit that PM Modi's "Mann ki Baat" radio program is strikingly refreshing and a much needed change after a decade of wondering when Dr. Manmohan Singh would open his mouth. And even if he did open his mouth, one would need a very high-speed camera (talking about several thousand frames/sec) to capture that spectacular phenomenon. I guess that's too harsh -- knowing fully well that puppets don't speak. yea. We'll let that one pass and focus on the present.

So what does PM Modi do on the radio? Apart from jamming with Obama, he is generally found talking about new initiatives (clean India, organ donation, etc.). I think this is simply wonderful and to harness the power of the simple radio to reach out to millions of rural Indians is a stroke of brilliance. A perfect follow-up act to using holographs while on the campaign trail. 

So how does a man with a great idea like "Mann ki Baat" at his disposal, with oratorial skills second-to-none, a man who doesn't ned notes (unlike Rahul baba who can't remember what the three monkeys signify with the help of a cheatsheet), a man whose vocabulary goes far beyond "women empowerment" and "my grandmother" -- how does such a leader lose the plot completely and lets a bunch of goons and motor-mouths go scotfree while not saying anything on the matter. 

Arnab Goswami's debates were getting painful to watch with the Congress spokespersons holding on to only one question - "Why doesn't the PM talk about this?" Seriously, why didn't he talk about this?

Silence is slowly and steadily becoming a feature of Modi's prime ministership. When Vasundara Raje and Sushma Swaraj got entangled in the Lalit Modi visa issue, he kept quiet. When the Dadri lynching occured, he kept quiet. When the dalit children were killed, he kept quiet. When Kalburgi was murdered in Karnataka, he kept quiet. When the whole award-wapsi charade took place, he kept quiet. 

WHY?

Especially when you have the Mann ki Baat vehicle! PM Modi -- you could have held a radio + television interview and talked directly to the people in India's cowbelt. You could have given a subtle warning to the motor-mouths in the BJP and RSS to shut it. You could have innocently suggested that the Samajwadi Party and Congress get their act together and ensure that such incidents never take place again. In one fell swoop, you could have shut the award-wapsi charade even before it began. Unfortunately, you chose to stay silent and poor Anupam Kher had to bat in your place. You chose to remain silent and instead address these issues in the Parliament at the start of the Winter Session. Even though you delivered a well-crafted speech, you missed the bus by not talking when it mattered. Timing is everything in cricket and dialogue delivery and to milk this cliche dry -- you Sir, played a hook shot to a ball bowled in the previous match. 

A single radio show would have achieved several objectives (1) brought about the sense of security knowing that there is a PM who is looking out and is reactive and (2) put the onus where it lies -- at the state-level. How many Karnataka Sahitya Academy winners returned their awards? Close to none! Kalburgi and Janardhan Poojary were killed in Karnataka which is being ruled by the completely inept Siddharamaih and yet, nobody in the media bothered to grill the Congress party in a manner similar to how the BJP is getting their ass kicked. Stinks of supari journalism right? 

It is a different issue that India became intolerant before the Bihar elections and became tolerant after the results were announced. But having PM Modi speak when the issues were boiling over and spilling into our doorsteps would have been just perfect.

Do you think Modi's silence was one of the reasons behind the BJP's drubbing in Bihar?
