title: Clutter declutter

There are days when I can find my car keys and office ID when I need them and there are days when they refuse to be found. Intense statistical analysis has proved without doubt, that they prefer not to be found. Why I ask. Do I ill-treat them? Have I disrespected them? Why aren't they where I want them to be? In the midst of all of this metaphysical analysis of the missing-key-conundrum, the answer was staring me in the face -- I am simply dis-organized and yes, my house is cluttered. 

Clutter is a term I've grown to despise. When I hear the word "clutter", my general response is somewhere along the lines of,
+ My table is not cluttered -- ask me for anything and I'll tell you where it is. 
+ What?? I think you need to see a shrink -- you have OCD. My table is how it should be. 
+ Whatever .. (dramatic roll of the eyes follows).

It is not all difficult and here is how I am going to do it in my life.

1. **Try to not litter and to clean up after myself**: I am a huge slacker in this category and its not uncommon to see a pile of plates in my kitchen's sink. To think about it, it would have taken me a couple of minutes to rinse my plate/glass and give it a quick scrub. But laziness gets in the way and I end up pushing it late into the night and it never gets done and then I have to rush to work the next morning and you can see how this tale ends (or not). The not-littering part is actually easy - I am pretty clean, but I'll make a conscious effort to be cleaner!
2. **Reduce clutter**:  Oh man -- I can write a Dummies-101 on How-to-clutter! Its my insatiable thirst for the latest mechanical pencil, or the latest pair of shoes that drives this gluttony-related habit of mine. I am not a hoarder (my wallet ensures that I can't be one), but I can't seem to organize the stuff I own. While showering this morning, I finally figured out how to de-clutter my life -- -stop buying stuff stupid! Yes, okay, um .. and then? And then, you take a fine-toothed comb and go through the stuff you have and do the following.
  + Take two boxes and label them **NEED** and **DON'T NEED**.
  + And let the sorting begin. I used a simple rule-of-thumb -- if I haven't used it in a year (like really haven't even touched it), then I probably don't need it. Some items can be exempted from this (like my power-drill - I don't need it everyday, but it is expensive and very handy when I need to drill or assembling IKEA furniture). 
  + At the end of it, either throw or donate the stuff you don't need. Any local Goodwill or thrift store will take in your stuff, provided they aren't in terrible condition.
