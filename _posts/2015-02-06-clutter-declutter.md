There are days when I can find my car keys and office ID when I need them and there are days when they refuse to be found. Intense statistical analysis has proved without doubt, that they prefer not to be found. Why I ask. Do I ill-treat them? Have I disrespected them? Why aren't they where I want them to be? In the midst of all of this metaphysical analysis of the missing-key-conundrum, the answer was staring me in the face -- I am simply dis-organized and yes, my house is cluttered.

Clutter is a term I've grown to despise. When I hear the word "clutter", my general response is somewhere along the lines of,

+ My table is not cluttered -- ask me for anything and I'll tell you where it is. 
+ What?? I think you need to see a shrink -- you have OCD. My table is how it should be. 
+ Whatever .. (dramatic roll of the eyes follows).

Despite this bravado, it is time I face the fact. I clutter and I am not ashamed to admit it. I need to get a control over it and it is something I should do on a continual basis. The benefits are obvious. I **will** find my keys everytime I need them, I will have fewer things to take care of, more time to concentrate on reading and writing, free up money to buy quality stuff. There will be benefits on a much more subtle level I hope once I am done de-cluttering. 

So anyway, I went ahead and read a lot about de-cluttering online and I boiled down all the information to suit my particular situation and here goes. 

1. **Remember Mahatma Gandhi's maxim** "There is enough in this world for every man's need, but not for everyone's greed".
2. **Try to not litter and to clean up after myself**: I am a huge slacker in this category and its not uncommon to see a pile of plates in my kitchen's sink. To think about it, it would have taken me a couple of minutes to rinse my plate/glass and give it a quick scrub. But laziness gets in the way and I end up pushing it late into the night and it never gets done and then I have to rush to work the next morning and you can see how this tale ends (or not). The not-littering part is actually easy - I am pretty clean, but I'll make a conscious effort to be cleaner!
3. **Eliminate duplicates**:  I like to think that I am a collector. Myy insatiable thirst for the latest mechanical pencil, gel pen, or operating system (yes, I like switching OS's) fuels the clutter in my life. I am not a hoarder (my wallet ensures that I can't be one), but I can't seem to organize the stuff I own. While showering this morning, I came up with a two-point formula :- (1) stop buying stuff, and (2) sort and classify what I already own. Here's how I am going to sort my stuff ...
  + Take two boxes and label them **NEED** and **DON'T NEED**.
  + And let the sorting begin. I used a simple rule-of-thumb -- if I haven't used it in a year (like really haven't even touched it), then I probably don't need it. Some items can be exempted from this (like my power-drill - I don't need it everyday, but it is expensive and very handy when I need to drill or assembling IKEA furniture). 
  + At the end of it, either throw or donate the stuff I don't need.

 
I am not a fan of huge lists of do's and don'ts. I am aiming at sticking to this three-deep list and hope to de-clutter and free up my life!
