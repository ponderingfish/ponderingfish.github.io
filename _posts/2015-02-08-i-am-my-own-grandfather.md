title: I am my own grandfather

I was listening to a talk by the great contemporary Indian philosopher [Bannanje Govindacharya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bannanje_Govindacharya) and he talked about a very beautiful shloka from the Rig Veda. In the ancient times, a rishi (=*sage*) would "see" a Vedic mantra and hand it down generations. The shloka Bannanje spoke about was one such mantra, and here is a loose translation of it.  
<blockquote>
He was female but showed himself to us as male;
He who can see a lady as a man has eyesight;
He who cannot see a lady as a man is blind;
There is one son who knows this fact; 
And he is own grandfather.
</blockquote>

I had to do a double-take when I heard this shloka and I played it back a couple of times for obvious reasons. I just couldn't understand what it meant, but luckily, I had Bannanje's wonderful explanation to bank on. 

Bananje explains the first sentence as follows. God is female because only a mother can give birth (=*creation*) but he showed himself to us in his male form (=*Vishnu, Krishna, Rama, etc.*). This thought is echoed in the well-known maxim *Tvameva mAta ca pita tvameva*. He is both the male and female form and he exists in both the male and female beings as Paramatma! So, the person who knows and understands it has eyes and one who cannot is blind. Not physically, but internally. It is interesting what the ancient seers (seer implying one who has eyesight and can see) consider blindness. They are oblivious to physically attributes and rather peer inside your thoughts and your heart. 

The next part is even more beautiful! The question still remains -- who is the son mentioned in the shloka? Well, the son talked about here is Brahma. How? Well lets see  -- Brahma was born out of the lotus flower that bloomed from the navel of MahaVishnu. So, he was born of Vishnu, and we know (and so does Brahma) that Vishnu is both his mother and his father. But how does this imply that Brahma is his own grandfather?

Bannanje says, the role of a father is pretty minimal in a baby's life. The onus is entirely on the mother. One important role played by the father is the naming of the child. So, a person who plays a role in naming of the child is considered the father in this case. Now, Brahma is the realizer and composer of so many prayers that extol the virtues of Vishnu and has conferred so many epithets upon him! So, he gave names to God. Ergo, he is God's father and that makes him his own grandfather! Beautiful!

I was floored by the beauty and depth of this simple shloka. It contains two beautiful facts that struck me deeply -

+ we are all souls and that this male-female covering is temporary. Think and strive to live beyond it.
+ God is so magnanimous that he allows his devotees to confer names upon him and become his father!

I think that these two points are worth remembering and contemplating upon! Have a wonderful day!
